# Drone-Flight-Controller
Richard Clapham and Rakul Mahenthiran created an Android application and Website that allows the user to control either a Skywalker 1306 or Hubsan X4 micro drone. The application uses an Arduino to communicate with either drone and will record the users runtime information using a mySQL database with a PHP front. The dronesoftware.7z will contain a copy of all the files used to create the project. The word document is a technical report on how to build the hardware and the necessary requirements for the database.
