# Drone-Flight-Controller
Richard Clapham and Rakul Mahenthiran created an Android application and Website that allows the user to control either a Skywalker 1306 or Hubsan X4 micro drone. The application uses an Arduino to communicate with either drone and will record the users runtime information using a mySQL database with a PHP front.
